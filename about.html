          <p>
            I am a Bengali-Canadian dude who likes to do computer stuff. As you
            may have read from my headline, I like programming, making music and
            playing video games. I am a second year Computer Science Student at
            the University of Toronto. I also love to teach people about the
            things I learn. I teach students about Computer Science concepts as
            a Computer Science Representative in AMACSS at my University. I
            taught students Calculus II on my TYEducational YouTube. They say
            the best way to master material is to teach it to be able to teach
            it to someone else, and I firmly believe that!

          <h3 class="text-secondary">Programming</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy programming primarily in Python and Java. I've made various
            programs for school and on the side which you can see in my projects
            section. I also and making websites with SASS and node.js such as
            this one.

          <h3 class="text-secondary">Music</h3>
          <p>
            I've been playing guitar since I was 12 years old. I used to make
            regular videos on my YouTube of covers and some originals. You can
            find my channel here. Nowadays, I make shorter form content on my
            instagram.

          <h3 class="text-secondary">Gaming</h3>
          <p>
            Another one of my favourite past-times is playing games on PC.
            Particularly skill-based games. I built a custom computer which you
            can find the specs for here.
