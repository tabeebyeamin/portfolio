# My portfolio Website
This is a responsive website that I made to show my projects, hobbies and interests. I used node.js and SASS to make it. You can view it at the link https://tabeebyeamin.com
Please let me know if there are any issues with it and I will fix it ASAP. 

## Here are some sample pages

The design was inspired by Brad Traversy: https://github.com/bradtraversy. I followed along with his YouTube tutorial but I put my own twists on it to make it more custom to me.
